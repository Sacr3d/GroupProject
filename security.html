                            Think about how you just logged into your portal, you have your own user ID to login which
                            allows you to differentiate you from the person sitting beside you right now üòä this is also
                            used to know who is currently assessing the system so there can be no mistakes. For example,
                            my User ID is jsmith12.
                        </p>

                            Now you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt anyone just log in to your account if they have your
                            ‚ÄúUser ID‚Äù well you‚Äôre correct that‚Äôs true, anyone could do that which is why after you enter
                            your User ID you‚Äôre prompted to give your password as a means of authentication,
                            Having a password helps to be more secure but it isn‚Äôt always the safest so make your
                            passwords long and complex.

                        <p>
                            Another couple forms of authentication could be biometrics such as ‚Äúfingerprint
                            recognition‚Äù. Or Pin-code verification. I am sure most of you with advanced technology will
                            understand the importance of these two because it‚Äôs being used everywhere nowadays. For
                            example, when you open your phone, I‚Äôm pretty sure all of you guys will use either a pin or
                            place down your finger onto your home screen to open your phone through your fingerprint.
                            These are reliable because pins can be difficult to guess if made well and fingerprints are
                            incredibly good because they can only be opened by someone with the same fingerprint as you.

                        <p>
                            Data integrity is very important in information systems because it means how accurate and
                            consistent data will stay over time, for example, data will lose its reliability and
                            integrity if it is constantly being changed over time, for example someone telling you a
                            different story every time you talk to them about a specific subject. What may cause this to
                            happen you may ask? Well here are a list of variables that could change data over time.

                            This is when a human alters data incorrectly whether it Is by accident or with malicious
                            intent.

                            Sometimes when data is passed through a system, the technology used can be faulty resulting
                            in altercated data and therefore affects its integrity as it is not 100% accurate. For
                            example, you could be sending an email to someone and the application could crash midway
                            potentially causing the data to be split.

                        <p>
                            Cryptography is the study of secure communications that only allow the intended recipient to
                            view content that is sent through a system. For example, if you send a file to someone
                            through google drive for example, the person who you have given permission to access the
                            file will be the only one that can access the file. This is also the same when young kids
                            like you send each other messages over the phone.

                        <p>
                            A VPN can be used to protect data as it basically scrambles data with encryption and makes
                            it difficult for anyone to get access to your internet activity. This is good for places
                            that use a public network like school to keep all your data safe as anyone can manipulate
                            public internet.
