                            Data privacy laws or data security laws forbids the release or abuse of data about private persons. Over 80 nations and autonomous nations territories, covering almost every country in Europe and others in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa,
                            have now implemented robust data security laws. Some principles for the privacy and protection act of consumer data:

                            Data from breaches is often sold to criminal groups who use the details to craft phishing emails. Phishing emails are likely to threaten clients of an enterprise that has experienced a data breach, regardless of whether their records have been breached.
                            It is how hackers take advantage of news reports that can threaten the clients with a compromised company with phishing emails using the breach subject line. Attackers are most likely aiming for financial benefit. This may
                            be obvious methods such as tricking victims into sending money or uploading financial passwords stealing malware. Instead they may try to implicitly monetize the attack by collecting information that is then passed on and could
                            be used to encourage further attacks.

                            A data breach can cause irreparable damage and can have long-lasting effects. In addition to the large fines that may be imposed because of non-compliance, organizations may face additional operating downtime costs, implement new security measures, and
                            compensate affected customers. Breaches can also have a major effect on customer trust and harm to the credibility of the company. The sad fact is that many customers will lose trust in a company if they feel that their company
                            if they feel that their data is not adequately secured which will in turn drive down their value by the mismanagement of data breaches.

                            Whilst phishing emails are designed to be difficult to spot, there are some checks which users can employ to identify the less sophisticated campaign. Usually the email may contain a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. The strongest
                            security, as well as knowledge, is to keep the computers and apps up to date. Also be sure to check the sender, subject line, logo, the email introduction, and links and attachments.
