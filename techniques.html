                        <p>
                            Why is a background check good you ask? A background check is a good technique in verifying
                            if someone is trustworthy and fit for a role in security. Background checks usually make
                            sure to check for criminal records, employment history and education that you guys are
                            wishing to obtain at our school.

                        <p>
                            Encryption is a good technique because it changes information into a code that not everyone
                            can see and reverts to its original form when someone that has authorised access tries to
                            access it. Think about it as you are speaking in a different language that only you and your
                            friend can see, and the only people who can understand it are the people you have allowed to
                            see.
                        </p>

                <div id="hashing" class="modal">
                    <div class="modal-content">
                        <span class="close" onclick="window.close('hashing')">&times;</span>
                        <span class="modal-title"><strong>Hashing.</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            Hashing is generating a value of a text and turning it into a mathematical function that can
                            only be unlocked by the intended recipient. So in simpler terms, it’s just like if you had a
                            code with the value of 1 sending it to your friend will also create a hash and give him a
                            value of 1 too and when they match it’ll mean that the recipient can open it.
                        </p>

            <div id="container-monitoringsolutions">
                <button id="button-monitoringsolutions" class="width-issues grow"
                    onclick="openModal('monitoringsolutions');">Monitoring Solutions</button>

                <div id="monitoringsolutions" class="modal">
                    <div class="modal-content">
                        <span class="close" onclick="window.close('monitoringsolutions')">&times;</span>
                        <span class="modal-title"><strong>Monitoring Solutions.</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            Monitoring solutions is good because it gives you an up to date and real time assessment of
                            changes that are being made and help to monitor any cyber threats that come and go. This
                            helps many information systems to react faster to situations as they are constantly being
                            updated if something were to change.
                        </p>

                    Controls</button>

                <div id="accesscontrol" class="modal">
                    <div class="modal-content">
                        <span class="close" onclick="window.close('accesscontrol')">&times;</span>
                        <span class="modal-title"><strong>Access Controls.</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            When access is being controlled it can be a good technique because everyone understands what
                            they are allowed to use and what they are not allowed to use in order to avoid a slip up
                            where a non or unexperienced employee could gain access to an cause problems for the
                            company. This is why you students aren’t allowed to access any website because you could
                            enter a website that could be risky and compromise our internet data.
                        </p>

                        <span class="modal-title"><strong>Backups.</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            Backups are good because if any information is lost it can be traced back and found again,
                            this is good for companies because it gives them extra reassurances for their customers. We
                            also have backups for all you students so if anything happens, we can help you all!
